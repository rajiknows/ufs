1.Implementing Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for Routing

Choose a DHT algorithm (e.g., Kademlia, Chord)
Implement node ID generation using a consistent hashing function
Create a routing table structure to store known peers
Implement node lookup and routing logic
Add methods for joining and leaving the network
Implement periodic routing table maintenance
Update the Network struct to include the DHT
Modify existing methods to use DHT for peer discovery and file location

1. Choose a DHT algorithm (e.g., Kademlia, Chord)
2. Implement node ID generation using a consistent hashing function
3. Create a routing table structure to store known peers
4. Implement node lookup and routing logic
5. Add methods for joining and leaving the network
6. Implement periodic routing table maintenance
7. Update the `Network` struct to include the DHT
8. Modify existing methods to use DHT for peer discovery and file location


2. Implement Content-Addressable Storage (CAS):

To implement CAS, you'll need to modify your existing file storage system. Here are the steps:

- Update the `FileSystem` struct to use content hashes as keys
- Modify the `add_file` method to compute the content hash before storage
- Update the `get_file` method to retrieve files using their content hash
- Implement deduplication to avoid storing duplicate content
- Add a method to verify file integrity using the content hash

3. Enhance the network protocol:

- Add new message types for DHT operations (e.g., FindNode, FindValue)
- Implement handlers for the new message types in the `handle_connection` function
- Update the `discover_nodes` method to use the DHT for more efficient node discovery

4. Improve fault tolerance and redundancy:

- Implement data replication across multiple nodes
- Add periodic health checks for known peers
- Implement a mechanism to re-replicate data when nodes go offline

5. Optimize file transfers:

- Implement chunking for large files to enable parallel downloads
- Add support for resumable file transfers
- Implement a simple caching mechanism to improve performance

6. Enhance the CLI:

- Add commands for DHT operations (e.g., lookup a key, find closest nodes)
- Implement a command to display the current routing table
- Add options for configuring replication factor and other DHT parameters

7. Implement basic security measures:

- Add support for signed messages to prevent tampering
- Implement basic access control for file uploads and downloads
- Add an option for encrypted storage of sensitive files

Remember, these are high-level steps and each one will require careful implementation and testing. Start with the core DHT and CAS functionality, then gradually add the more advanced features.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan?
